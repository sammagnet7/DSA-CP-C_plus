Problem statement:
There are n cities connected by some number of flights. You are given an array flights where flights[i] = [fromi, toi, pricei] indicates that there is a flight from city fromi to city toi with cost pricei.

You are also given three integers src, dst, and k, return the cheapest price from src to dst with at most k stops. If there is no such route, return -1.

Examples:
    Example 1:
    Input: n = 4, flights = [[0,1,100],[1,2,100],[2,0,100],[1,3,600],[2,3,200]], src = 0, dst = 3, k = 1
    Output: 700
    Explanation:
    The graph is shown above.
    The optimal path with at most 1 stop from city 0 to 3 is marked in red and has cost 100 + 600 = 700.
    Note that the path through cities [0,1,2,3] is cheaper but is invalid because it uses 2 stops.

    Example 2:
    Input: n = 3, flights = [[0,1,100],[1,2,100],[0,2,500]], src = 0, dst = 2, k = 1
    Output: 200
    Explanation:
    The graph is shown above.
    The optimal path with at most 1 stop from city 0 to 2 is marked in red and has cost 100 + 100 = 200.

    Example 3:
    Input: n = 3, flights = [[0,1,100],[1,2,100],[0,2,500]], src = 0, dst = 2, k = 0
    Output: 500
    Explanation:
    The graph is shown above.
    The optimal path with no stops from city 0 to 2 is marked in red and has cost 500.
 

Constraints:
    1 <= n <= 100
    0 <= flights.length <= (n * (n - 1) / 2)
    flights[i].length == 3
    0 <= fromi, toi < n
    fromi != toi
    1 <= pricei <= 104
    There will not be any multiple flights between two cities.
    0 <= src, dst, k < n
    src != dst

    /**********************************************************************************************
    Approach 1: Dijkstra's Algorithm with a twist (using a priority queue)

    ðŸ”¹ How it works:
    - This problem is a variation of Dijkstra's algorithm where we need to find the cheapest path, but with an additional constraint: the number of stops.
    - Standard Dijkstra finds the shortest path by distance alone, without considering the number of edges. Here, a simple path with many stops might be cheaper than a direct, expensive flight. The 'k' constraint limits the number of edges.
    - We adapt Dijkstra's by modifying the state we store in the priority queue. Instead of just `{price, node}`, we use `{{stops, price}, node}`. This allows us to prioritize states based on price, while also keeping track of the stops.
    - The priority queue will sort primarily by the total price, ensuring we always explore the cheapest path first.
    - We use a `minDist` array to keep track of the cheapest price to reach a node, similar to standard Dijkstra.

    ðŸ”¹ Why does this not work?
    - The primary issue with this implementation is that the priority queue sorts by price, but the relaxation `if(newN_dist < minDist[adjN])` doesn't consider the number of stops.
    - A path with fewer stops might have a higher cost to reach an intermediate node, but could lead to a cheaper final path.
    - For example, if we reach node B via a path with 2 stops and a cost of 100, and then later we find a path with 3 stops to B with a cost of 110, we will correctly ignore the second path. However, what if the 3-stop path is actually a sub-path of the optimal solution? The `minDist` array prevents us from exploring a path to a node that has already been "finalized" with a seemingly better price, even if a path with more stops could be a better sub-solution for the rest of the journey.
    - The correct approach requires a different state to be stored: `minDist[node][stops]` to store the minimum cost to reach a node with a certain number of stops. The provided code only uses `minDist[node]`, which loses the stop count information.

    ðŸ”¹ Complexity:
    - Time Complexity: O(E * log V) in the best-case where there are no stops constraints. With the stops constraint, it's inefficient and potentially incorrect due to the `minDist` array not accounting for stops. The number of states can be up to `n * k`. So the time complexity would be roughly O(E * log(E*k)). This implementation is flawed for the reasons mentioned above.
    - Space Complexity: O(V + E) for the adjacency list + O(V*k) for the priority queue in the worst case (multiple paths to the same node).
