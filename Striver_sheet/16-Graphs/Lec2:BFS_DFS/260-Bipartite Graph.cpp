Problem statement:
There is an undirected graph with n nodes, where each node is numbered between 0 and n - 1. You are given a 2D array graph, where graph[u] is an array of nodes that node u is adjacent to. More formally, for each v in graph[u], there is an undirected edge between node u and node v. The graph has the following properties:

There are no self-edges (graph[u] does not contain u).
There are no parallel edges (graph[u] does not contain duplicate values).
If v is in graph[u], then u is in graph[v] (the graph is undirected).
The graph may not be connected, meaning there may be two nodes u and v such that there is no path between them.
A graph is bipartite if the nodes can be partitioned into two independent sets A and B such that every edge in the graph connects a node in set A and a node in set B.

Return true if and only if it is bipartite.

Examples:
    Example 1:
    Input: graph = [[1,2,3],[0,2],[0,1,3],[0,2]]
    Output: false
    Explanation: There is no way to partition the nodes into two independent sets such that every edge connects a node in one and a node in the other.

    Example 2:
    Input: graph = [[1,3],[0,2],[1,3],[0,2]]
    Output: true
    Explanation: We can partition the nodes into two sets: {0, 2} and {1, 3}.


Constraints:
    graph.length == n
    1 <= n <= 100
    0 <= graph[u].length < n
    0 <= graph[u][i] <= n - 1
    graph[u] does not contain u.
    All the values of graph[u] are unique.
    If graph[u] contains v, then graph[v] contains u.

    /**
     * @brief Check if an undirected graph is bipartite using BFS
     *
     * A graph is bipartite if we can color its vertices using two colors such that
     * no two adjacent vertices have the same color.
     *
     * Approach:
     * - Use BFS to traverse each connected component.
     * - Assign a color (0 or 1) to the starting node.
     * - For each adjacent node:
     *      - If uncolored, assign the opposite color and push into queue.
     *      - If already colored, check for color conflict.
     * - If any conflict occurs, return false.
     * - If all components satisfy bipartite conditions, return true.
     *
     * Time Complexity: O(V + E)
     * - Each vertex is visited once.
     * - Each edge is checked at most twice (once for each vertex).
     *
     * Space Complexity: O(V)
     * - For color array and BFS queue.
