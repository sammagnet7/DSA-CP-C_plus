# Striver sheet
This repository I will use to store the hands-on from Striver's sheets.

- Vscode shortcuts I use in this workspace:
1. cntrl+shift+r -> Run task -> select Task with label "COMPILE and RUN with IO" as mentioned in the tasks.json
2. ALT -> for enabling and disabling top menu bar.
3. Alt + Z  -> "Word Wrap" feature
