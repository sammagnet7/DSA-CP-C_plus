Problem statement:
You are given an array 'arr' containing 'n' non-negative integers.
Your task is to partition this array into two subsets such that the absolute difference between subset sums is minimum.
You just need to find the minimum absolute difference considering any valid division of the array elements.

Note:
1. Each array element should belong to exactly one of the subsets.
2. Subsets need not always be contiguous.
3. Here each subset size need to be same
4. No negetive elements are present in given array

For example, for the array : [1, 2, 3], some of the possible divisions are
   a) {1,2} and {3}
   b) {1,3} and {2}.
3. Subset-sum is the sum of all the elements in that subset.
Example:
Input: 'n' = 5, 'arr' = [3, 1, 5, 2, 8].
Ouput: 1
Explanation: We can partition the given array into {3, 1, 5} and {2, 8}.
This will give us the minimum possible absolute difference i.e. (10 - 9 = 1).

Example:
    Sample Input 1:
    4
    1 2 3 4
    Sample Output 1:
    0
    Explanation for sample input 1:
    We can partition the given array into {2,3} and {1,4}.
    This will give us the minimum possible absolute difference i.e. (5 - 5 = 0) in this case.
    Sample Input 2:
    3
    8 6 5
    Sample Output 2:
    3
    Explanation for sample input 2:
    We can partition the given array into {8} and {6,5}.
    This will give us the minimum possible absolute difference i.e. (11 - 8 = 3).

Expected time complexity:
The expected time complexity is O(n * ùö∫ 'arr'[i]), where ùö∫ 'arr'[i] denotes the sum of all elements in 'arr'.

Constraints:
1 <= 'n' <= 10^3
0 <= 'arr'[i] <= 10^3
0 <= ùö∫ 'arr'[i] <= 10^4,
where ùö∫ 'arr'[i] denotes the sum of all elements in 'arr'.

Time Limit: 1sec

2. Title: Partition Array Into Two Arrays to Minimize Sum Difference with [Array having negetives and partitions  are of same size]

Problem statement:
You are given an integer array nums of 2 * n integers. You need to partition nums into two arrays of length n to minimize the absolute difference of the sums of the arrays. To partition nums, put each element of nums into one of the two arrays.
Return the minimum possible absolute difference.

Note:
    1. Array having negetives as well
    2. Partitions must be of same size i.e. N/2

Examples:
    Example 1:
    Input: nums = [3,9,7,3]
    Output: 2
    Explanation: One optimal partition is: [3,9] and [7,3].
    The absolute difference between the sums of the arrays is abs((3 + 9) - (7 + 3)) = 2.

    Example 2:
    Input: nums = [-36,36]
    Output: 72
    Explanation: One optimal partition is: [-36] and [36].
    The absolute difference between the sums of the arrays is abs((-36) - (36)) = 72.

    Example 3:
    Input: nums = [2,-1,0,4,-2,-9]
    Output: 0
    Explanation: One optimal partition is: [2,4,-9] and [-1,0,-2].
    The absolute difference between the sums of the arrays is abs((2 + 4 + -9) - (-1 + 0 + -2)) = 0.


Constraints:
1 <= n <= 15
nums.length == 2 * n
-107 <= nums[i] <= 107

        Approach: Recursive Backtracking with Memoization (Top-Down DP)
        ---------------------------------------------------------------
        The goal is to partition the given array into two subsets such that
        the absolute difference between their sums is minimized.

        Key idea:
        - Total sum = S
        - Let one subset have sum = curSum
        - Then the other subset has sum = S - curSum
        - The absolute difference = abs(S - 2*curSum)
        - We try all possible subset sums using recursion with memoization
        and track the minimum abs(S - 2*curSum)

        Note: This code assumes all elements are non-negative.

        Time Complexity:
        - There are N elements and at most 'total' unique values for curSum
        - So: O(N * total) in worst case

        Space Complexity:
        - DP table of size O(N * total)
